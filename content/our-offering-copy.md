  quote: 'Sporting Chance Project, in conjunction with my school, helped me to focus
    on my academic studies, which allowed me to participate in sport alongside my
    Maths and English qualifications. I am now travelling to New Zealand following
    a two-year spell in Australia. This wouldn''t have been possible without all of
    the help I''ve received along the way. '
