  quote: Throughout [my son]'s educational years, I have had to fight with professionals
    to get him an education. I was not one of these parents who didn’t care. Without
    your support, hard work and compassion, [my son] wouldn’t be the happy, vibrant
    lad he has become. The bond and trust he has with Rufus [SCP mentor] is amazing.
    I have to say he is a credit to Sporting Chance. You both worked your socks off
    for months to get [my son] this happy. I will be eternally grateful. Your company
    goes above and beyond. Thank you, Tony. Your support has changed my son's life
