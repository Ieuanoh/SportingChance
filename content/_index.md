Without your support, hard work and compassion, [my son] wouldn’t be the happy, vibrant lad he has become. The bond and trust he has with Rufus [SCP mentor] is amazing. I have to say he is a credit to Sporting Chance.\n\nYou both worked your socks off for months to get [my son] this happy.  I will be eternally grateful. Your company goes above and beyond.\n\nThank you, Tony. Your support has changed my son's life"
